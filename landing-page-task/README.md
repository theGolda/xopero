# Landing Page + PHP Task

## Getting Started

Docker and docker-compose are required.  
Run in the terminal:
- `docker-compose up`

---

## Tasks

1. Check and fix errors related to, among others:
   - the `docker-compose.yml` configuration,
   - form security,
   - page responsiveness.
2. Implement sending form data to the `contact.php` script.
3. Implement saving data to the `submissions.json` file in the `contact.php` script:
   - besides the form data, also save the submission date.
4. Perform a brief analysis of the page regarding performance, accessibility, and SEO (e.g., using Lighthouse) and describe what and how you improved.

## Structure

- `index.html` - front-end
- `contact.php` - backend
- `styles/` - SCSS styles (compiled to CSS)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker configuration
- `submissions.json` - file for saved submissions

Good luck!
